Overview

This MATLAB script calculates the maximum height reached by a projectile given its initial velocity and height. The program takes user inputs for the planet, initial height, and initial velocity, then computes the projectile motion using kinematic equations.

Usage Instructions

Run the script in MATLAB.

Enter the required inputs when prompted:

Planet name

Initial height (ft)

Initial velocity (ft/s)

View the displayed results in the Command Window.

Observe the projectile motion plot.

Expected Output

The script prints the maximum height and the time at which it occurs.

A graph of the projectileâ€™s motion is displayed with the peak height indicate
